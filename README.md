Custom version of Source Engine, based on Mapbase and SDK 2013 CE.

Kiwi Source (KiwiSrc) is a custom built version of Valves Source®️ Engine, It is based on both Mapbase (all code excluding KiwiSrc, Material System and VRAD) and Source SDK 2013 Community Edition. 

KiwiSrc's goal is to create a "Semi-Modern" version of Source engine that could possibly compete with Source 2. This means improved VRAD, Improved Rendering (Shaders), More reliance on GPU and a host of other improvements. This isn't ment to be the engine the next TitanFall runs on nor will it be, it is for the community by the community.

Currently we have More passes on VRAD, Higher patches on VRAD, No limit on Transfers (Confirm), more light bounceing,
PBR.

What is planned:
Improved Real Time Reflections, Proper High-Resolution Texture support, Texture Streaming (maybe),
improved AI.

NOTES:
No MP, luxels can be visible under circumstances where they are on an angle,
There are issues with compileing ported maps this is due to how KiwiSrc uses BSP21-V2 and has issues with Half Life 2 maps. it can load maps for hl2 but has Issues with compileing maps from hl2.
